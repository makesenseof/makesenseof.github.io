          <h1><i>Einstein’s Miracle Year (1905)</i><br/></h1>
<h3>While working at the patent office, Einstein did some of the most creative work of his<br/> life, producing no fewer than four groundbreaking articles in 1905 alone. <br/>In the first paper, he applied the quantum theory (developed by German physicist Max Planck) to light in order to <br/>explain the phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect, by which a material will emit <br/><br/>electrically charged particles when hit by light. The second article contained <br/>Einstein’s experimental proof of the existence of atoms, which he got by analyzing the phenomenon of Brownian motion, in which tiny particles <br/>were suspended in water.<br/>
In the third and most famous article, titled “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,”<br/> Einstein confronted the apparent contradiction between two principal theories of physics:<br/> Isaac Newton’s concepts of absolute space and time and James Clerk Maxwell’s idea that the speed <br/>of light was a constant. To do this, Einstein introduced his special theory of relativity,<br/><br/> which held that the laws of physics are the same even for objects moving in <br/>different inertial frames (i.e. at constant speeds relative to each other), and that the speed of light is a constant in all inertial <br/>frames. A fourth paper concerned the fundamental relationship between mass and energy, concepts<br/> viewed previously as completely separate. Einstein’s famous equation E = mc2 (where “c” was<br/> the constant speed of light) expressed this relationship.</h3>
