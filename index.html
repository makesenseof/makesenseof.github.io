<h1>NONCONFORMIST-INSATIABLY CURIOUS-CLOWN-GENIUS  Mr.Feynman</h1>
    
    <h3><This book is an Anecdotal Autobiography of One of the greatest Theoretical Physicists of all time & Nobel Laureate ,  Richard Feynman.
The stories in this book were collected intermittently and informally by Ralph Leighton during his seven years of friendship with Feynman.He found each story by itself to be amusing , and the collection taken together to be amazing.
It is sometimes hard to believe , that one person could have so many wonderfully crazy things happen to him in one life.
As is with any great book , you might forget what it said , you might forget what it looked like , but you will never forget how it made you feel.
That is exactly why you should read “Surely You’re Joking Mr.Feynman”.
You’ll feel wonder , passion, delight , discovery , curiosity , laughter , adventure , A whole lot of mischief and an Undeniable amount of Sheer Brilliance.
I think the title “Surely You’re Joking Mr.Feynman” is very appropriate. It is actually a waitress’s reply when Feynman was asked if he wanted lemon or cream in his tea , because he replied that he wanted both.
It’s appropriateness as the title of the book is justified because the stories were so damn amazing that they were unbelievable.
So whenever he narrated these stories to his colleagues , they thought he must be joking . That’s how the title came to be.

All the anecdotes in the book are divided into 5 parts. Each part describing a phase of his life.
Feynman was born in 1918 in a small town called Far Rockaway.
The book is full of funny stories ranging from how he is judged as mentally deficient by the Army to how he learned to pick up girls in bars.
He discovers how to keep track of time in his head.
When he was asked how much he valued his life , he answers “64”.
He explains how he got to play a key role in developing The Atomic Bomb(Manhattan Project) & what happened during then.
Sounds serious?
Trust me.
You’ll be Surprised when you learn what really happened there.
Few of My personal favourites stories are ‘Who stole the door’ , ‘Safe cracker meets Safe cracker’ , ‘Testing Bloodhounds’ , ‘You just ask them’ , ‘A map of the cat’ . The list goes on.
